# Portfolio
This is my very first mobile-responsive web page <br>
I made it to showcase my work and my skills all on one page <br>
## Features - <br>
Works well on mobile <br>
Important content is highlighted <br>
Buttons are responsive and user-friendly <br> 
The code is clean and easy to understand <br>
Only used HTML5 & CSS3 till now 
## Further Plans- <br>
To add JavaScript (as soon as I master JavaScript) <br>
To add a copy feature, email, and number get copied when the user clicks on it <br>
Reload my progress bars when they come into the viewport <br>
Make a database for form <br>
